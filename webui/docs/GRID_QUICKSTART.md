### Filter Combinations
- Use all 4 filters together for precise results
- Common use case: Search term + Author + Website
- Filters narrow results progressively (each filter reduces results further)

- Change page size to see more/fewer results per page
- Use pagination to explore your entire collection
- Current page is always clearly marked in orange
