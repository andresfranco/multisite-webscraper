## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-19

### Release Summary

Production release with full CLI implementation, session management optimization, and comprehensive documentation. All 32 tests passing (23 unit tests + 9 functional CLI tests).

### Added

#### CLI Interface (October 19)
- Complete `argparse` command-line interface implementation
- `--urls` (required): Accept single or multiple URLs to scrape
- `--workers` (optional): Configure thread count for parallel processing (default: 5)
- `--mode` (optional): Debug mode for verbose logging (normal/debug)
- Full help text with usage examples via `--help`
- Argument validation and error handling
- Configuration display in debug mode

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Single website
python main.py --urls https://realpython.com/

# Multiple websites
python main.py --urls https://realpython.com/ https://www.freecodecamp.org/news

# Custom workers
python main.py --urls https://realpython.com/ --workers 3

# Debug mode
python main.py --urls https://realpython.com/ --mode debug
```

**Testing:**
- 9 functional CLI tests created and passing
- Tests cover: help output, single URL, multiple URLs, custom workers, debug mode, error handling
- Zero regressions in existing functionality

#### Documentation (October 19)
- Created [00_GETTING_STARTED.md](00_GETTING_STARTED.md) - Quick start guide
- Created [06_CLI_INTERFACE.md](06_CLI_INTERFACE.md) - Comprehensive CLI reference (400+ lines)
- Complete README rewrite for GitHub repository
- Created CHANGELOG.md (this file) for tracking changes
- Documentation reorganized into `/docs` folder
- Improved navigation between documentation files

### Changed

#### Session Management Refactoring (October 18)
- Refactored `webscraper_core/manager.py` to create single database session
- Previously: New session created for each worker thread
- Now: Single session created once in `run_many()` and shared across all workers
- Benefits:
  - Reduced memory usage
  - Fewer database connections
  - Better performance with multiple URLs
  - Thread-safe design maintained

**Implementation Details:**
- Session created before `ThreadPoolExecutor` initialization
- Passed to `_process_single()` for each worker
- Passed to `_save_articles_to_db()` for database operations
- Properly closed in `finally` block to ensure cleanup

**Testing:** All 23 unit tests verified passing after refactoring

#### Project Organization
- Created `.gitignore` with comprehensive Python rules
- Root documentation files moved to `/docs` folder
- Redundant status documents consolidated
- README.md updated with GitHub repository focus
- Project structure clarified

### Fixed

- None (no bugs reported or found)

### Removed

- Deleted `05_STATUS.md` from documentation
- Removed redundant/duplicate summary documents
- Cleaned up old README backup

### Testing

**Test Results:**
```
✓ 23 unit tests passing
✓ 9 functional CLI tests passing
✓ Total: 32/32 tests passing (100%)
✓ Zero test failures
✓ Zero regressions
```

**Coverage Areas:**
- URL scraping across 3 different websites
- Article extraction and deduplication
- Database operations and relationships
- CLI argument parsing and validation
- Error handling and edge cases
- Concurrent processing with multiple workers
- Configuration and debug modes

### Known Limitations

- Scraper performance depends on website load and network conditions
- Some websites may rate-limit or block scraper requests
- Limited to specified websites (Real Python, FreeCodeCamp, DataCamp)

### Performance Metrics

- **Articles Extracted**: 61 total across 3 websites
  - Real Python: 19 articles
  - FreeCodeCamp: 25 articles
  - DataCamp: 17 articles
- **Database Performance**: Optimized with single session
- **Concurrent Processing**: Configurable from 1-10 workers
- **Memory Usage**: Significantly reduced with session refactoring

### Dependencies

- Python 3.12+
- beautifulsoup4 (HTML parsing)
- sqlalchemy 2.0+ (ORM)
- cloudscraper (Cloudflare bypass)
- pytest 6.2.5 (testing)
- requests (HTTP)

### Breaking Changes

None - fully backward compatible with previous scraper behavior.
